# Mindful Web (local demo)

This is a minimal Angular scaffold to run a simplified, local-only version of the `Mindful Tracker` UI (no Firebase).

How to run locally (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd webapp
npm install
npm run start
```

Notes:
- The app stores entries in `localStorage` for demo purposes.
- If you want full Firebase integration, install the Firebase SDK (already listed) and configure credentials or emulator.
